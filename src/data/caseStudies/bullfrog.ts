/* The live music room upstairs at Andy's on Peach Street. Every claim here is
   visible on the live site or measured from it, and nothing names a band, a
   date or a door time — those are data the calendar happens to be holding.
   Each line of copy names its own capture in `scripts/shots/bullfrog.mjs`, and
   `npm run check:budget` proves it resolves. */
