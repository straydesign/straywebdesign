/* DeviceDuo — a laptop with the phone build overlapping its lower-left corner.
   Both captures are real. A responsive site shown on one screen is a claim;
   shown on two it is the evidence.

   The phone is a photoreal render now, and it carries 60px of margin around
   the handset plus a taller screen, so its outer proportion went from roughly
   2.31:1 to 1.96:1 — at the old 22% width it stood 15% shorter and stopped
   overlapping the laptop. 26% restores the height it had, which is what the
   overlap was composed around.

   `z-20` because MacBookFrame paints its lid and deck at `z-10`: without it
   the laptop covers the half of the phone it is supposed to sit behind. */
